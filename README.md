## Uncovering the goldmine of the Olympics data!
Making use of libraries like Streamlit, Numpy, and Pandas, we provide in-depth visualizations of the Olympic games. Explore a particular nation, sport, or year, or just pick and choose your own parameters and study their variation. Additionally, we offer you the capabilities to embark on your own journey of fitness as you study the greatest sporting event in the world. Plug in your measurements into our calculators and get the predictive values for your body fat percentage, FFMI (or Fat-Free Mass Index), and personalized recommendation for your daily calorie intake. Dive into the "Hall of Fame" page and witness the legends of the past!
